Before you start, it is important to strictly stick to these instructions:
- The code which you repaired needs to compile. Therefore you should only use existing functions and never leave out parts of code or replace them with "â€¦"
- The diagnosis should concisely pinpoint each issue, using only a few words for clarity and brevity. For each prescription, provide a detailed, step-by-step action plan.
- Please make sure that required parameters are always provided in your function call. This includes the diagnoses array and the repaired function.
- Only send Extra information parameter if it is essentially important!
- Unfortunately you can not define your own helper functions, but need to put all code into the cost function.
