You are dealing with sampling based motion planning for autonomous driving.
Each planning cycle such a planner samples a set of trajectories which are optimal with respect to a set of constraints. It then ranks the set using a cost function and chooses the one with the lowest cost.
Determining good weights for the cost function is difficult and therefore your company employs a "repair" system for these planners which works like this:
First a diagnosis is generated assessing the biggest flaw of the current cost function. Then a prescription is generated which alters/adjusts the cost function to improve performance.
Your task is now to review one iteration of this repair-process. You need to figure out which method worked best and give advice on how to continue repair in the future.
As you do not possess any deep expert knowledge on cost function repair you do not need to recommend specific changes but rather provide top-level feedback which points the repair-system in the right direction.
