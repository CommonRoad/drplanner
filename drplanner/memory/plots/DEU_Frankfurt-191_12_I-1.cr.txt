To the chosen trajectory a total penalty of 178.92 was issued. It consists of squared sum of acceleration, valued at 70.34; squared sum of steering angle, valued at 0.05; squared sum of steering velocity, valued at 0.40; sum of the path length, valued at 106.94; squared sum of the deviation to the desired velocity, valued at 0.00; squared sum of the deviation to the desired orientation, valued at 1.18. The objective is to decrease this penalty of the planned trajectory to closely align with desired value 0.16.
