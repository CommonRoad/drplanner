To the chosen trajectory a total penalty of 173.25 was issued. It consists of squared sum of acceleration, valued at 64.26; squared sum of steering angle, valued at 0.06; squared sum of steering velocity, valued at 0.42; sum of the path length, valued at 107.34; squared sum of the deviation to the desired velocity, valued at 0.00; squared sum of the deviation to the desired orientation, valued at 1.17. The objective is to decrease this penalty of the planned trajectory to closely align with desired value 0.16.
