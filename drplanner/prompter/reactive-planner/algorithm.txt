The planner to repair is a sampling based reactive planner. Each planning cycle it samples a set of trajectories which are optimal with respect to a set of constraints. Then it ranks all of these trajectories and chooses the best one. Your job is to write a cost function which assigns a high cost if the trajectory is bad and vice versa. This will then be used by the planner for the ranking.
