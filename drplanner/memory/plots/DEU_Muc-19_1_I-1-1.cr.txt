To the chosen trajectory a total penalty of 16.17 was issued. It consists of squared sum of lateral jerk, valued at 0.25; squared sum of longitudinal jerk, valued at 5.92; squared sum of the deviation to the desired longitudinal velocity, valued at 0.00; inverse of the duration of the trajectory, valued at 10.00. The objective is to decrease this penalty of the planned trajectory to closely align with desired value 0.16.
