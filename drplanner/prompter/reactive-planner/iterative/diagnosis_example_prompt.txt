Problem: The acceleration cost is quite high and the main factor behind bad performance.
Reason: The current cost-function does not sufficiently discourage the planner from picking trajectories with frequent or intense actuation of the throttle.
Approach: Identify the physical factors which influence acceleration and increase the weights of the corresponding partial cost-functions.
Solution: Influencing factors are acceleration_costs and its derivatives: jerk_costs and everything related to it. Introduce these factors to the function and increase their weights.
