- Ensure that the improved code is free from errors and that all modifications positively impact the final outcome.
- Be cautious when adjusting weights or constants, particularly when setting them to zero.
- When modifying 'if', 'elif', and 'else' constructs, consider that changes may yield variable outcomes across different situations.
- The diagnosis should concisely pinpoint each issue, using only a few words for clarity and brevity. For each prescription, provide a detailed, step-by-step action plan.
- Adhere strictly to all specified instructions. In case of a contradiction with your knowledge, offer a thorough explanation.
