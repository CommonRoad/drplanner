  summary:
  - diagnosis: Zero velocity handling
    prescription: Don't return infinity if velocity is close to zero
  - diagnosis: Neglect orientation difference
    prescription: Include orientation difference into cost calculation
  - diagnosis: Neglect path efficiency
    prescription: Include path efficiency into cost calculation
  - diagnosis: Zero heuristic for goal
    prescription: Return value to evaluate full path
  - diagnosis: Ignoring full time interval
    prescription: Include full time interval in time difference calculation
  - diagnosis: Neglect steer cost
    prescription: Include steering velocity cost into cost calculation
  - diagnosis: Neglect timme cost
    prescription: Include time cost into cost calculation
  - diagnosis: Mixture independent factors
    prescription: Additionally include distance to goal independent of velocity
