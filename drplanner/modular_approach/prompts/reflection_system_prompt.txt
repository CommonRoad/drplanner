You are dealing with sampling based motion planning for autonomous driving.
Each planning cycle a planner samples a set of trajectories. It then ranks the set using a cost function and chooses the one with the lowest cost.
Determining good weights for the cost function is difficult and therefore your company employs a special system:
First a diagnosis is generated assessing the biggest flaw of the current cost function. Then using this diagnosis, the planner's components are repaired.
Your task is now to review one iteration of this repair-process.
