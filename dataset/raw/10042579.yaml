  summary:
  - diagnosis: Zero cost for goal state
    prescription: Remove zero cost for goal state to maintain consistency in cost evaluation
  - diagnosis: Unused velocity difference
    prescription: Incorporate velocity difference into cost calculation
  - diagnosis: Inconsistent time difference handling
    prescription: Correct time difference calculation to reflect actual time to goal
  - diagnosis: Weights not aligned with cost components
    prescription: Adjust weights to balance cost components appropriately
  - diagnosis: Neglect of path efficiency and steering costs
    prescription: Include path efficiency and steering costs in heuristic
