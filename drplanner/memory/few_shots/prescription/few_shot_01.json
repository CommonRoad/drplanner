      "key": "Problem: The cost function is not effectively discouraging frequent or intense actuation of the throttle leading to high acceleration costs.\nReason: The weights assigned to factors influencing acceleration are not sufficient to prioritize minimizing acceleration costs in trajectory selection.\nApproach: Identify and increase the weights of factors related to acceleration costs and its derivatives in the cost function to better penalize high acceleration trajectories.\nSolution: Increase the weights of acceleration_costs, jerk_costs, and related factors while decreasing the weights of other cost factors to prioritize minimizing acceleration costs in trajectory selection.",
