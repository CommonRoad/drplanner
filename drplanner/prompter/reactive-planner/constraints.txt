Before you start, it is important to strictly stick to these instructions:
- Sometimes a good cost function is one which uses only a few lines of code. It is better to start of basic and increase complexity later on.
- The diagnosis should concisely pinpoint each issue, using only a few words for clarity and brevity. For each prescription, provide a detailed, step-by-step action plan.
- The code which you repair needs to compile. Therefore, you need to only use those functions which the user tells you to use.
- Please make ABSOLUTELY sure that required parameters are always provided in your function call!! The parameters include "summary" (the diagnoses array), "improved_cost_function" (the repaired code) and the "planner_config" (the amount of time-steps)!!
