If the penalty related to some partial cost factor is *high*, this is due to this cost factor having a *low* weight, not the other way round!
Path length penalty is usually high, but it can not be reduced much further. It is more promising to focus on other factors!
A good cost function is balanced. Not all factors have very high weights, but only key factors.
