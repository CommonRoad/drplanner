1   clean up the codebase to have a clean version to branch off
2   todo: reconsider the current diagnose-repair cycle issue
    -> Maybe add constraint to consider the past advice and not to resend anything etc...#
    -> Decouple the function description and the planner description
        FD: Used methods, PD: current code, base
3   delete path_length cost and add velocity + distance cost
4   do not require extra information anymore by adding it to constraints - works semi-well
5   provide error handling if no optimal trajectory was found
5b  todo: modularize the diagnose-repair
5c  todo: modularize the prompt structure!
6   todo: think of how to implement modular error handling to dr. planner
    -> Own class
7   todo: add "time_steps" from planner.config as a tunable parameter to the repair
8   todo: add plots as visual input to the evaluation feedback
9   todo: automate function description of all class/superclass methods
10  todo: let LLM request class descriptions at runtime
11  todo: add a DangerZone... if the performance gain is stagnating increase temperature
